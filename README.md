This repo contains the frontend and backend in separate folders.

The frontend code is written in react. 
So, it needs nodejs to be first installed on your machine. (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
React tutorial can be found here. (https://reactjs.org/)

The backend code is written in C#.
We are using ASP.Net Core MVC for backend. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-2.2)

Microsoft Visual Studio and Microsoft Visual Stuido Code are helpful for development.
Our data lies in Kusto Database. You can find more about it here(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/)
